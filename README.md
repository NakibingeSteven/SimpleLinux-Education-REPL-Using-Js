# Linux Command REPL

This is a simple web-based Linux Command REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that emulates a basic command-line interface. You can use it to practice and learn common Linux commands in a web browser.

## Features

- Emulates common Linux commands like `ls`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, and more.
- Print the current working directory using `pwd`.
- Clear the screen using `clear`.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Type Linux commands in the input box, and press Enter to execute them.

4. The output will be displayed below, following the style of real Linux command-line messages.

## Available Commands

Here are some of the available commands:

- `ls`: List files and directories.
- `mkdir <directoryName>`: Create a new directory.
- `cp <source> <destination>`: Copy files or directories.
- `mv <source> <destination>`: Move or rename files or directories.
- `cat <filename>`: View the content of a text file.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `clear`: Clear the screen.
